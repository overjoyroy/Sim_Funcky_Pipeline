# Sim_Funcky_Pipeline

Sim_Funcky_Pipeline is a pipeline designed to preprocess BOLD Functional MRIs for visualization and further analysis. This tool also calculates the average signal intensity per ROI in a given volumetric atlas and returns a pairwise similarity matrix. 

## Overview

The preprocessing pipeline closely follows the recommendations outlined by Power et al 2014:

> Power JD, Mitra A, Laumann TO, Snyder AZ, Schlaggar BL, Petersen SE. Methods to detect, characterize, and remove motion artifact in resting state fMRI. Neuroimage. 2014 Jan 1;84:320-41. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.048. Epub 2013 Aug 29. PMID: 23994314; PMCID: PMC3849338.


These steps include (but are not limited to):

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Reorientation**: Aligning the MRI images to a standard orientation.
- **Skull Stripping**: Removing non-brain tissues from the MRI images.
- **Rigid Body Realignment**: Correcting for patient movement during the scan.
- **Median 1000 Normalization**: Normalizing the voxel intensity distribution to its median.
- **Demeaning**: Centering the data around zero.
- **Motion Parameter Regression**: Removing 6 motion parameters, their squares, derivatives, and derivative's squares (total of 24).
- **Bandpass Filtering**: Applying a bandpass filter to the data.
- **Spatial Smoothing**: Applying a smoothing filter to the data.
- **Registration**: Aligning an atlas to the patient space for standardized anatomical referencing.
- **Scrubbing**: Censoring frames with excessive motion.
- **Average Regional Signal and Similarity Calculation**: Computing average signal intensity per ROI and generating a pairwise Pearson correlation matrix.

## Features

- Written primarily in Python.
- Utilizes the Nipype library for workflow management.
- Employs tools such as FSL and ANTs for processing tasks.
- Compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Standard.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
At minimum:
- **Parent Data Directory**: The directory containing the MRI data.
- **Subject ID**: Identifier for the subject/patient.
- **Output Directory**: Directory where the processed outputs will be saved.

### Outputs

1. **Preprocessed Patient BOLD**: The MRI after all preprocessing steps.
2. **Atlas in Patient Space**: An atlas registered to the patient’s anatomical space.
3. **Average regional signal intensity and similarity matrix**

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Tool Directly

To use this tool directly, run the following command:
```
python3 Pipeline.py -p [data_dir_path] -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path]
```

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Using Docker is recommended to simplify the installation of necessary dependencies (including FSL, ANTs, and relevant Python libraries). There are two ways to use Docker: building and running the container locally, or using a prebuilt Docker image from Docker Hub.

**Option 1: Building and Running the Container Locally**
1. Clone the Git repository and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
2. Build the Docker container:
```
docker build -t my_Sim_Funky_Pipeline_container .
```
3. Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -v [data_dir_path]:/data/my_data -v [output_path]:/data/output --rm -u $UID:$UID my_Sim_Funky_Pipeline_container -p /data/my_data -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path] 
```

Explanation of Docker Flags:

```--rm```: Automatically removes the container after it exits. <br>
```-v```: Mounts your data and output directories into the Docker container.<br>
```-u``` $UID:$UID: Runs the Docker container as the same user as on the host machine to avoid file permission issues.

*Notes:
If the output directory is a subdirectory of the data directory (e.g., \[data_dir_path\]/derivatives), you only need to mount the data directory once and provide the output path relative to the mounted data directory (e.g., /data/my_data/derivatives). Output files will be accessible on the host machine from where the output path was mounted. Default anatomical templates and atlas (MNI152 and AAL2 respectively) are included so the -tem and -seg flags are optional.*

**Option 2: Using a Prebuilt Docker Image**
1. Pull the prebuilt Docker image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull jor115/sim_funcky_pipeline
```
2. Run the Docker container using the pulled image:
```
docker run -v [data_dir_path]:/data/my_data -v [output_path]:/data/output --rm -u $UID:$UID jor115/sim_funcky_pipeline -p /data/my_data -sid [subject-id] -o [output_path] 
```
*Note: The docker run command is identical to the one used for running a locally built container, but you do not need to download the source code or build the container locally.*

## Development Status

This tool is a work in progress. It is currently fully functional but is undergoing refinement to enhance user flexibility and input handling.
